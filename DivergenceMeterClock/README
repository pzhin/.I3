Divergence Meter Clock by MakiseKuritorisu
Thanks to Mrat for helping with some errors! Hopefully everything's working now!
Release 3.

Changes:
- fixed some parentheses problem (thanks again Mrat, I trust you it's ok this time!! xD)
- D-Mails shouldn't now cause nausea for people with Reading Steiner

Installation:
0. You need conky installed for the script to work! (Conky Manager is also helpful)
1. Copy the DivergenceMeterClock folder (yes the one you're in now) into ~/.conky
2. Add the script into Conky just like any other theme,
3. El. Psy. Kongroo.

The script *may* be slow on older computers because it's made in a kinda hacky way (symlinking 7 images every second).
Something is broken? Message me on reddit or DeviantArt!
